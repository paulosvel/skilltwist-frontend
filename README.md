Phase 1: Planning and Preparation
Duration: 1-2 Days

Define Requirements:

Decide on core features (Skill Listings, Matching Algorithm, Chat, Rating System).
Plan user roles (e.g., Regular Users, Admin).
Identify any stretch goals (e.g., Notifications, Premium Features).
Design the Database Schema:

Users:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "password": "hashed string",
  "skills_offered": ["string"],
  "skills_needed": ["string"],
  "bio": "string",
  "rating": "number",
  "reviews": ["ObjectId"]
}
Listings:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "user_id": "ObjectId",
  "skill_offered": "string",
  "skill_needed": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "status": "string (open/closed)"
}
Chats:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "participants": ["ObjectId"],
  "messages": [
    {
      "sender_id": "ObjectId",
      "text": "string",
      "timestamp": "Date"
    }
  ]
}
Reviews:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "user_id": "ObjectId",
  "reviewer_id": "ObjectId",
  "rating": "number",
  "comment": "string",
  "timestamp": "Date"
}
Set Up Tools:

Code Editor: VS Code.
Version Control: Git + GitHub.
Libraries: React, Express, MongoDB, Socket.io, TailwindCSS/Material-UI.
External Services:
Authentication: Firebase/Auth0/JWT.
Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) + Render/Heroku (Backend).
Phase 2: Backend Development
Duration: 4-6 Days

Initialize the Backend:

Set up an Express server.
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.
Implement environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., MongoDB URI).
User Authentication:

Implement user registration/login with hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt).
Use JWT for authentication.
Create middleware to protect private routes.
API for Skill Listings:

Endpoints:
POST /api/listings: Create a new listing.
GET /api/listings: Fetch all listings (with filters for skill_offered or skill_needed).
PUT /api/listings/:id: Update listing status.
DELETE /api/listings/:id: Delete a listing.
Integrate basic search and filtering.
Matching Algorithm:

Match users based on overlapping skills_offered and skills_needed.
Endpoint: GET /api/matches/:userId.
Rating and Reviews API:

Users can rate and review others post-exchange.
API Endpoints:
POST /api/reviews: Add a review.
GET /api/reviews/:userId: Fetch all reviews for a user.
Chat System:

Create a Chats collection in MongoDB.
Use Socket.io for real-time messaging.
API Endpoints:
POST /api/chats: Start a chat.
GET /api/chats/:chatId: Fetch chat messages.
POST /api/chats/:chatId/messages: Send a new message.
Phase 3: Frontend Development
Duration: 5-7 Days

Initialize the Frontend:

Set up React with Vite or CRA.
Install TailwindCSS/Material-UI for styling.
Configure Axios for API calls.
User Authentication:

Create signup/login forms.
Manage authentication state using Context API or Redux.
Skill Listings:

Create pages:
Home Page: Displays all listings with search/filter options.
Listing Details Page: Shows details of a specific listing.
Add forms for creating/updating listings.
Matching Algorithm:

Display recommended matches for logged-in users on their dashboard.
Use API to fetch matches dynamically.
Chat System:

Build a real-time chat interface using Socket.io.
Display active conversations in a sidebar.
Integrate message notifications (optional).
Rating and Reviews:

Show user ratings and reviews on their profile page.
Add a review form to leave feedback after skill exchanges.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and accessible.
Phase 4: Testing
Duration: 2-3 Days

Unit Testing:
Write tests for API endpoints using Jest or Mocha.
Frontend Testing:
Use React Testing Library for component tests.
Test user flows like creating a listing, matching, chatting, and reviewing.
Manual Testing:
Test the app across devices and browsers.
Look for edge cases like invalid inputs or unauthorized access.
Phase 5: Deployment
Duration: 1-2 Days

Backend Deployment:

Host the backend on Render or Heroku.
Ensure the MongoDB database is deployed using services like MongoDB Atlas.
Frontend Deployment:

Deploy the frontend on Vercel or Netlify.
Configure environment variables for the API URL.
Connect Frontend and Backend:

Test the full app after deployment to ensure APIs are working seamlessly.
Phase 6: Enhancements
Duration: Ongoing

Add Features:

Notifications for new matches or messages.
Admin dashboard to manage users and content.
Payment integration for premium features (if any).
Optimize Performance:

Use lazy loading for images/components.
Implement server-side pagination for large datasets.
Gather Feedback:

Share the app with friends or online communities for testing.
Use feedback to refine the UX/UI.
Estimated Timeline: ~15-20 Days
